## Pok√©mon Search

This test project is about getting to know React components and
how to host React page on Github.
It started with JHerr's tutorial from Youtube.

I have used several tutorials, PokeApi source, GitHub Copilot and other helpful sites
to build this. This is unfinished and I keep updating it.
